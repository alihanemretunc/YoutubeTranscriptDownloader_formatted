For reference, see the part "Provided Formatter Example" in this link: https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/
Note that the link gives this line of code: transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
But video_id should be "video_id".
Also, the code probably works best for videos in English. 
For example, I tried Turkish, but it doesn't recognize Turkish letters that are not in English alphabet.
No big deal though.
